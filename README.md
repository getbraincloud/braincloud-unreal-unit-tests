## Example Projects

Examples of using brainCloud in your Unreal Projects can be found [here](https://github.com/getbraincloud/examples-unreal).

## Troubleshooting

Here are a few common errors that you may see on your first attempt to connect to brainCloud.

- **App id not set**: Verify you've set up the app id and app secret correctly in the `initialize()` method.
- **Platform not enabled**: Verify you've enabled your platform on the portal.

If you're still having issues, log into the portal and give us a shout through the help system (bottom right icon with the question mark and chat bubble).

## brainCloud Summary

brainCloud is a ready-made back-end platform for the development of feature-rich games, apps and things. brainCloud provides the features you need – along with comprehensive tools to support your team during development, testing and user support.

brainCloud consists of:
- Cloud Service – an advanced, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) back-end
- Client Libraries – local client libraries (SDKs)
- Design Portal – a portal that allows you to design and debug your apps
- brainCloud Architecture

## What's the difference between the brainCloud Wrapper and the brainCloud Client?
The wrapper contains quality of life improvement around the brainCloud Client. It may contain device specific code, such as serializing the user's login id on an Android or iOS device.
It is recommended to use the wrapper by default.

## How do I initialize brainCloud?
![wrapper](/screenshots/_bp-init.png?raw=true)
Create a BrainCloudActor to store the instance of brainCloud.

Initialize your created brainCloud Instance.

Set the default instance, so you don't have to pass brainCloud into each function call, unless needed.


Your Secret Key, and App Id, is set on the brainCloud dashboard. Under Design | Core App Info > Application IDs

![wrapper](/screenshots/bc-ids.png?raw=true)

Wrapper Name prefixes saved operations that the wrapper will make. Use a Wrapper Name if you plan on having multiple instances of brainCloud running.


----------------

#### Newly upgraded?
If your app is already live, you should **NOT** specify the Wrapper Name - otherwise the library will look in the wrong location for your user's stored anonymousID and profileID information. Only add a name if you intend to alter the save data.

---------------


Version is the current version of our app. Having an Version less than your minimum app version on brainCloud will prevent the user from accessing the service until they update their app to the lastest version you have provided them.

## How do I keep the brainCloud SDK updating?
In your project's update loop, you're going to want to update brainCloud client so it can check for responses.

To do this, you need to call Run Callbacks

## How do I authenticate a user with brainCloud?
The simplest form of authenticating with brainCloud is Anonymous Authentication.

## How do I attach an email to a user's brainCloud profile?
After having the user create an anonymous with brainCloud, they are probably going to want to attach an email or username, so their account can be accessed via another platform, or when their local data is discarded. Attaching email authenticate would look like this.

Attaching email authenticate would look like this.

There are many authentication types. You can also merge profiles and detach idenities. See the brainCloud documentation for more information:

## Building for Android
For developers looking to build their project for Android, note that you can only package one architecture at a time (ex.ARM64, ARMv7, etc.)

BCClient plugin builds ARMv7 by default.
If another architecture is required, continue with these steps:

1. Go to the BCClient plugin and open Source/BCClientPlugin/BCClientPlugin.Build.cs.
2. At the top of the file, uncomment the #define of the architecture you intend to build and make sure the others are commented.
3. Ensure the Engine.ini file is also appropriately set. Set only the architecture you are trying to build to true. In the editor's project settings under the Android platform, you can also affect your Engine.ini file by checking off the architecture you're trying to build.
4. Build your apk!

***If you have trouble building, make sure you have the appropriate sdk and tools to build for your desired android architecture. You can check this with your android sdk manager.***
